Greetings esteemed reader. I like solving problems and finding patterns. I am an aspiring machine learning engineer and researcher.

My research interests revolve around everything machine learning with a focus on deep learning. I also like software development and deploying products at scale. I have done projects and have a keen interest in problems involving resource-constrained machine learning, scene and optical character recognition, object detection and tracking, zero-shot image tagging, weakly-supervised image segmentation, navigational path planning and swarm robotics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning based products
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on integrating machine learning and software development for delieverables
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source based research involving machine learning or machine learning competitions
